# Video Lesson Activity Plugin for Moodle™

A modern video learning activity plugin built specifically for Moodle™ sites. Video Lesson is designed to help teachers teach and learners learn through **video-driven courses**.

The plugin supports uploading or embedding videos, organizing them in a central **Video Library**, enforcing **completion rules** (such as minimum watch percentage and disabling fast-forward), tracking **video analytics**, and streaming smoothly through AWS for scalable performance.

Educators can create structured video lessons, monitor learner engagement, and ensure compliance for training programs—all directly inside Moodle courses.

---

## Purpose

Moodle supports video files, but it does not provide:

- A dedicated video activity type

- Minimum watch percentage completion rules

- Engagement analytics (watch time, drop-offs, etc.)

- Seek/fast-forward control for compliance

- A centralized video library

- Built-in scalable video delivery workflows

Video Lesson Activity was created to solve these gaps in a clean, Moodle-integrated way.

---

## Key Features

**Dedicated Video Activity**

Add video lessons just like any other Moodle activity from Moodle activity chooser — no external dashboards.

**Video Library**

Organize, manage, and reuse videos across courses from a central, built-in library.

**Video Analytics**

Track:

- Watch time

- Completion percentage

- Total views

- Learner-level engagement data

**Video Completion Rule**

Require learners to watch a minimum percentage (e.g., 90%) before marking activity complete.

Optional seek/fast-forward control for compliance-driven training.

**Bulk Upload Videos**

Upload multiple videos at once; the plugin prepares them for streaming automatically.

**Multiple Video Sources**

- Direct uploads, or from Video library, 

- Self-hosted URLs,

- Youtube or Vimeo

**AWS Video Hosting**

Enable adaptive streaming, automatic transcoding, and scalable delivery using your own AWS infrastructure or MooPlugins hosting.

**Clean Video JS Player**

Distraction-free interface powered by VideoJS. Mobile-friendly and optimized for learning focus.

**TinyMCE Editor Button**

Use the optional `tiny_videolesson` companion plugin to insert Video Lesson content inside labels, pages, descriptions, and other TinyMCE-supported areas.
